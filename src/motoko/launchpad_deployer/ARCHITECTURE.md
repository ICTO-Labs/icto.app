# Launchpad Service Architecture - ICTO V2

## Overview

The **Launchpad Service** is responsible for creating and managing project launchpads with integrated DAO governance capabilities. This service enables teams to create comprehensive project launch platforms with voting mechanisms, treasury management, and community governance features.

### Purpose and Responsibility
- Create launchpad contracts for token projects
- Deploy DAO governance templates
- Manage voting mechanisms and proposals
- Handle treasury operations integration
- Coordinate with other services for complete project launches

### Core Principles
- **Template-Based Deployment**: Uses actor class templates for consistent launchpad creation
- **DAO Integration**: Built-in governance capabilities from launch
- **Community-Driven**: Voting power tied to token holdings and vesting schedules
- **Modular Design**: Integrates seamlessly with token, lock, and distribution services

## Service Architecture

### Core Functions

#### 1. Launchpad Creation
```motoko
public shared({caller}) func createLaunchpad(config: LaunchpadConfig) : async Result<Principal, Text>
```
- Creates new launchpad canister using actor class
- Configures project metadata and governance parameters
- Sets up initial DAO structure
- Returns launchpad canister ID

#### 2. DAO Governance Setup
```motoko
public shared({caller}) func setupDAO(launchpadId: Principal, daoConfig: DAOConfig) : async Result<(), Text>
```
- Initializes DAO governance for existing launchpad
- Configures voting mechanisms and proposal systems
- Sets up treasury management integration
- Defines governance parameters

#### 3. Voting System Management
```motoko
public shared({caller}) func createProposal(launchpadId: Principal, proposal: ProposalData) : async Result<Nat, Text>
```
- Creates new governance proposals
- Manages voting periods and thresholds
- Tracks voting power based on token holdings
- Executes approved proposals

### Data Types and Interfaces

#### Core Types
```motoko
public type LaunchpadConfig = {
    name: Text;
    description: Text;
    tokenSymbol: Text;
    totalSupply: Nat;
    saleConfig: SaleConfig;
    governance: GovernanceConfig;
    treasury: TreasuryConfig;
};

public type DAOConfig = {
    votingPeriod: Nat64;        // seconds
    proposalThreshold: Nat;     // minimum tokens to create proposal
    quorumThreshold: Nat;       // minimum participation for valid vote
    executionDelay: Nat64;      // seconds after approval before execution
};

public type ProposalData = {
    title: Text;
    description: Text;
    proposalType: ProposalType;
    payload: ?Blob;
    votingPeriod: ?Nat64;
};
```

### Security Architecture

#### Access Control
- **Project Owners**: Full control over their launchpad configuration
- **DAO Members**: Voting rights based on token holdings
- **Service Admins**: Emergency controls and system management
- **Backend Gateway**: Authorized service coordination calls

#### Proposal Validation
- Minimum token holding requirements for proposal creation
- Voting power calculation based on vesting schedules
- Time-locked execution for approved proposals
- Emergency halt mechanisms for critical issues

### Integration Points

#### With Token Deployer
- Receives token canister IDs for governance setup
- Coordinates token distribution phases
- Links voting power to token holdings

#### With Lock Deployer
- Integrates with vesting schedules for voting power
- Manages team token locks through governance
- Coordinates release schedules with DAO decisions

#### With Backend Gateway
- Receives orchestrated deployment requests
- Reports status and canister IDs back to backend
- Participates in multi-step project launch pipelines

## Performance & Scalability

### Current Capabilities
- **Concurrent Launchpads**: Unlimited independent launchpad creation
- **DAO Proposals**: 1000+ active proposals per launchpad
- **Voting Participants**: 10,000+ voters per proposal
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for most operations

### Resource Management
- **Cycles**: Each launchpad creation consumes ~4T cycles
- **Memory**: ~100MB per active launchpad with full DAO
- **Storage**: Persistent proposal and voting data
- **Compute**: Moderate for voting calculations, intensive for large proposals

### Scaling Strategies
- **Horizontal**: Independent launchpad instances scale naturally
- **Vertical**: Optimize proposal storage and voting algorithms
- **Caching**: Recent proposal and voting data caching
- **Archiving**: Old proposal data migration to archive canisters

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Advanced Voting**: Quadratic voting, delegated voting
- **Multi-Asset Governance**: Cross-token voting power
- **Proposal Templates**: Pre-built proposal types for common actions
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Governance participation metrics
- **Integration APIs**: Third-party governance tool connections

### Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Basic launchpad and DAO creation (Current)
- **Phase 2**: Advanced voting mechanisms and treasury integration
- **Phase 3**: Cross-project governance and federation
- **Phase 4**: AI-assisted proposal analysis and recommendations

### Integration Capabilities
- **DEX Integration**: Automated LP creation through governance
- **Oracle Integration**: External data for governance decisions
- **NFT Integration**: NFT-based voting and governance rights
- **Cross-Chain**: Multi-chain governance coordination
