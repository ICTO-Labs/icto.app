# Launchpad Factory Architecture - ICTO V2

## Overview

The **Launchpad Factory** is a comprehensive service for creating and managing decentralized token launch platforms on the Internet Computer. It follows the ICTO V2 architecture pattern of Backend → Factory → Contract, providing a secure, scalable, and feature-rich launchpad solution with integrated payment processing, audit trails, and advanced tokenomics.

### Purpose and Responsibility
- Create sophisticated launchpad contracts for token projects
- Manage complete project lifecycle from configuration to token distribution
- Integrate payment validation and audit logging through Backend orchestration
- Provide advanced features: vesting, affiliate programs, governance integration
- Coordinate with other V2 services (TokenFactory, DistributionFactory, DAOFactory)
- Ensure security, compliance, and automated processing

### Core V2 Principles
- **Backend Orchestration**: All operations flow through the Backend canister for unified payment, audit, and validation
- **Template-Based Deployment**: Uses actor class templates for consistent, secure launchpad creation
- **Fee-First Validation**: All critical operations require validated fee payment before execution
- **User-Centric Ownership**: Users own deployed contracts; system is non-custodial
- **Interface-Driven Design**: Well-defined interfaces promote loose coupling and maintainability
- **Modular Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with token, distribution, lock, and DAO services
- **Security-First**: Multiple validation layers, emergency controls, and audit trails

## V2 Architecture Flow

### 1. Backend Orchestration Layer
The Backend canister serves as the single entry point for all launchpad operations, providing:
- **Unified API**: Single endpoint for all launchpad operations
- **Payment Processing**: Fee validation and payment collection before execution
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations and state changes
- **Authorization**: User authentication and permission validation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and user-friendly messages

### 2. Factory Service Layer
The LaunchpadFactory canister handles:
- **Contract Deployment**: Creates new launchpad contracts using actor classes
- **Template Management**: Maintains and versions launchpad contract templates
- **Health Monitoring**: Tracks deployed contract health and status
- **Upgrade Coordination**: Manages contract upgrades and migrations

### 3. Contract Instance Layer
Individual LaunchpadContract actors provide:
- **Sale Management**: Handles participant contributions and allocations
- **Lifecycle Automation**: Timer-based status transitions and processing
- **Token Integration**: Interfaces with ICRC token standards
- **Vesting Coordination**: Integrates with DistributionFactory for vesting
- **DAO Integration**: Connects with DAOFactory for governance features

## Core Factory Functions

#### 1. Launchpad Deployment (via Backend)
```motoko
// Backend endpoint
public shared({caller}) func createLaunchpad(
    config: LaunchpadTypes.LaunchpadConfig,
    projectId: ?ProjectTypes.ProjectId
) : async Result<LaunchpadTypes.CreateLaunchpadResult, Text>
```

**Flow:**
1. Backend validates payment and creates audit log
2. Backend calls LaunchpadFactory.createLaunchpad()
3. Factory deploys new LaunchpadContract with config
4. Backend registers deployed contract in FactoryRegistry
5. Backend updates audit log with success/failure

#### 2. Launchpad Management
```motoko
// Factory functions
public shared({caller}) func pauseLaunchpad(launchpadId: Principal) : async Result<(), Text>
public shared({caller}) func cancelLaunchpad(launchpadId: Principal) : async Result<(), Text>
public shared({caller}) func upgradeLaunchpad(launchpadId: Principal, newVersion: Text) : async Result<(), Text>
```

#### 3. Query Functions
```motoko
public query func getLaunchpad(id: Principal) : async ?LaunchpadTypes.LaunchpadDetail
public query func getAllLaunchpads(filter: ?LaunchpadTypes.LaunchpadFilter) : async [LaunchpadTypes.LaunchpadDetail]
public query func getUserLaunchpads(user: Principal) : async [LaunchpadTypes.LaunchpadDetail]
public query func getFactoryStats() : async FactoryStats
```
